# User Journey

Alex is an intermediate climber who joined a gym with a Kilter board. They want to train systematically but feel overwhelmed browsing through hundreds of problems in the official app, most of which seem either too easy or impossibly hard. After spending 20 minutes scrolling through random V4s and V5s, they give up frustrated and just repeat the same few problems they completed last week.

Next session, Alex opens Boardlord. The home interface (view 1) shows a clean grid of problems with basic filtering options at the top. They select 40Â° as their board angle and set filters for "V4-V5" grade and select crimp holds in the advanced hold search since they want to work on finger strength. The advanced hold search finds climbs that use the specific crimp holds Alex has selected. The results immediately show a smaller subset of relevant problems instead of hundreds of random routes.

Alex clicks on a problem that looks interesting. The climb view (view 2) displays the full board visualization with highlighted holds in different colors for start, hand holds, foot holds, and finish positions. After a few minutes of struggling, Alex can't seem to figure out a way to do the climb that suits his body type, as they're on the shorter end heightwise. Luckily, Alex sees plenty of beta videos providing different solutions to the climb from all types of people. They find a video from someone of a similar stature who completed the climb.

After watching the video, Alex heads back to the board knowing exactly which holds to use and having seen an approach that suits his body type. They successfully complete the climb, then return to Boardlord to find similar crimp-heavy problems to continue their focused training session. Instead of wasting time hunting for appropriate climbs, Alex spends the full hour actually climbing and improving the specific technique.
